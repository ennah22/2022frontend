    	<li><b>1944</b>- Rejects a 100% salsry increase from Dupont, Leaves behind hisbpregnant wife, and flies to mexico to head a new plant pathology program over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each  major climate on earth</li>
    	<li><b>1945</b>- Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season doubling wheat yields</li>
    	<li><b>1953</b>- Crosses a short sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeilding American breed/ creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer, it goes on to provide 95% of mexico's wheat.</li>

Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds"</li>
    	<li><b>2009</b>- dies at the age of 95</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to thr far-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."</i></p>
