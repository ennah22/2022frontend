	<p><h2>This is a Website Built With HTML.</h2></p>
	<p>And its really perfect.</p>
	<p><h3>Seriously, what else do you want?</h3></p>
	<p>You probably should build websites and thimk your shit is special. You think your13 megabytes paralax-active home page is going to get some award banner you can glue at the top cconner of your site. You thik your  40-pound jQuery file and 83 plyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, Let me describe your perfect website;</p>
	<ul>
		<li>shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
		<li>Fits in all you screens</li>
		<li>Looks the same in all your browers</li>
		<li>Its accesible to everyone who visits your sites</li>
		<li>Shits legible and gets your point across(if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffe</li>
	</ul><br><br>
	<p>Well guess what guys:</p>
	<p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit, it's a website. Why do you need to animate a fucking trendy banner fleg when i hover over that piece of shit? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your sitr,and some jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see thst shit.Not to mention blind people will never see that shit,but they don't see any of your shits.</p>
	<p><h5>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. here's why.</h5></p>
	<p><h3>It's Light Weight</h3></p>
	<p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could annimate the background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi" at 100px height at the begining of your site?.</p>
	<p><h3>Its responsive </h3></p>
	<p>You though you needed the media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever screensize its viewed on. This site doesnt care if you are on an iMac or Tamagotchi</p>
	<p><h3>It works</h3></p>
	<p>Look at this shit can you read it......that is, if you can read. it makes sense. it has hierarchy. It's usind HTML5 tags so you and your browser know what is in the site. that's semantics.</p>
	<p>It has content on the screen. Your site has threebylines and links to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screen and make me click some boobing button to show me how cool the jQuery scroll to plug is.</p>
	<p>Cross-browser compatibility? load this.</p>
	<p>This is a website. Look at it. you've never seen one before.</p>
	<p>Like the man who's never grown outhis  beard has no idea what his true nature state is,you haveno idae what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communication a message. Thia is a real naked website. look at it  its beautiful.</p>
	<p><h3>Yes, this is satire.</h3></p>
	<p>I'm not actually saying your site should look this; What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with website are <strong>ones we create ourselves.</strong>  websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accesible. You break them.</p>
